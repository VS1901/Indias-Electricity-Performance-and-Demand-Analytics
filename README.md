## 📌 Project Overview

Electricity is a critical infrastructure for economic growth. This dashboard provides insights into:

- State-wise electricity generation and capacity
- Demand and seasonal variations
- Month-on-Month (MoM) performance changes
- Top and bottom performing states
- Moving averages and volatility trends

This project demonstrates my ability to:
- Work with real-world datasets
- Clean and transform data
- Create business-focused dashboards
- Extract meaningful insights using Power BI
